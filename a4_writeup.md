# Assignment 4 - Writeup

In assignment 4 we created a basic tic tac toe game so that we could learn object oriented programming. Respond to the following questions.

## Reflection Questions

1. What was the most difficult part to tic-tac-toe?
The most difficult part was checking to see if the player won the game, it was hard for me to think about how to actually check for 3 in a row in all different configurations.
2. Explain how you would add a computer player to the game.
I would add a computer player by creating a bot that generates random moves to play against the user.
3. If you add a computer player, explain (doesn't have to be super technical) how you might get the computer player to play the best move every time. *Note - I am not grading this for a correct answer, I just want to know your thoughts on how you might accomplish it.
I could find an api of some sort that has the best tictactoe strategy and implement the strategy to my bot so that it analyzes the moves and makes the best possible move according to the api.
